    <h1>Q.30 What are the looping structures in JavaScript? Any one Example?
    </h1>
    <p>There are three types of looping structures in JavaScript: <br>
        1> For loop: A for loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code based on a condition. The syntax is: <br>

        for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) { <br>
        // code block to be executed
        } <br>
        2>While loop: A while loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is met. The syntax is: <br>
        while (condition) { <br>
        // code block to be executed
        } <br>
        3> Do-while loop: A do-while loop is similar to a while loop, but it will always execute the block of code at
        least once, even if the condition is not met. The syntax is: <br>
        do { <br>
        // code block to be executed <br>
        } while (condition); <br>


    </p>
