    <h1>What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</h1>
    <h2>Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system.
        Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be
        nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

        Bootstrap comes with three different containers: <br>

        .container,<br>
        which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint <br>
        .container-fluid,<br> which is width: 100% at all breakpoints <br>
        .container-{breakpoint}, <br>which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint</h2>

    <h1>What are the default Bootstrap text settings?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Bootstrap 5: Default font-size is 1rem (16px) and line-height is 1.5 </li>

        <li> Bootstrap 4: Default font-size is 16px and line-height is 1.5</li>
        <li>Bootstrap 14px: Default font-size is 14px and line-height is 20px </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</h1>
    <h2>Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. <br>
        It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth look at how the grid comes
        together.</h2>

        <li>jQuery dependency  <br>
            Bootstrap 5 reduces jQuery dependency by using pure vanilla JavaScript instead.</li>
        <li>File size <br>
            Bootstrap 5 has a smaller file size than Bootstrap 4, which allows it to load components faster.</li>
        <li>Browser support <br>
            Bootstrap 5 supports the latest stable releases of all major browsers, while Bootstrap 4 supports Internet
            Explorer 10 and above.</li>
        <li>Form elements <br>
            Bootstrap 5 form elements have a custom design that gives them a consistent look and feel in all browsers.
        </li>
        <li>Tiers <br>
            Bootstrap 5 has six tiers (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl), while Bootstrap 4 has five.</li>
        <li>Color palette <br>
            Bootstrap 5 has an improved color palette with extra colors.</li>
        <li>Functions <br>
            Bootstrap 5 dropped the color(), theme-color(), and gray() functions in favor of variables. It also renamed
            the theme-color-level() function to color-level().
